# PERSONAL NOTES

This was an exercise as an access test for a masterâ€™s degree in videogame development form UPC school in Barcelona.
The exercise was meant to prove your knowledge and skills in c++ programming. To test our knowledge on C/C++ we will code a simple text mode conversational game. We should be
aiming for a well-organized code (efficiency is not important right now) where we explore C++ capabilities
like polymorphism.

I will describe my personal experience for this task.

I haven't code in c++ for 5 years, so I really struggled adapting for the language at the beginning.
First, I saw some examples on the internet and tried to understand everything, that took most of the time.
I had to recap many concepts, pointers, polymorphism, classes, etc. For the las 3 years I've been coding python microservices, so all of that was missing.
I define myself adaptive in this kind of situations so after some researching and recapping, I started to code the solution.
Based on the example given and the structure required I managed to do a little scape room.

The main features are:
	- Moving through rooms
	- Exits closed / locked
	- Minigame in which you can die if you enter the wrong room
	- Dark room (can't see anything) you must use flashlight
	- Unlock exit for finishing the game.
	
It was really frustrating at the beginning because I forgot a lot from c++, but at the end I really enjoyed making the game and even if I'm not accepted on the course, I will keep doing some personal projects and learning more because game development is something I really want to do.

#SOMETHING TO KNOW ABOUT THE CODE:
